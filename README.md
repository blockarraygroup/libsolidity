## Frameworks

**[Open Zeppelin Framework](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity)
OpenZeppelin is a library for writing secure Smart Contracts on Ethereum.

## Tools

**[QuickBlocks](https://github.com/Great-Hill-Corporation/quickBlocks)**
QuickBlocks is a collection of software libraries, applications, tools, and examples that allow you to retrieve Ethereum blockchain data (a) more quickly, (b) with higher information content, (c) in an fully decentralized way, (d) in a fully automated way, and (e) in a highly maintenance free way.

**[IDA-EVM](https://github.com/trailofbits/ida-evm)**
IDA-EVM allows you to analyze and reverse engineer smart contracts without source. To use it, follow the installation instructions in the readme, then open a .evm or .bytecode file in IDA.

**[Ethersplay](https://github.com/trailofbits/ethersplay)**
is a graphical EVM disassembler capable of method recovery, dynamic jump computation, source code matching, and binary diffing. Use Ethersplay to investigate and debug compiled contracts or contracts already deployed to the blockchain.
